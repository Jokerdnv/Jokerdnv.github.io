            <p>
                "To Build a Home" is a song by English electronic music group the Cinematic Orchestra, with vocals and piano performed by Canadian singer-songwriter Patrick Watson. It was released as the second single from the group's third studio album, Ma Fleur (2007), on 29 October 2007. The song's music video was notable for including themes of euthanasia[citation needed] in a short narrative film that also included the song ‘Breathe’, and ran to over 12 minutes. Shot on location in Cumbria, the video was premiered on Channel Four, featuring the actors Peter Mullan and Julia Ford, and directed by animator Andrew Griffin. In 2015, the song peaked at number 96 on the French Singles Chart.[1]
